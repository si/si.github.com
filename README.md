Si's Github Repos
=============

To make better use of my Github account and new found love for Git, this is a sandbox environment for everything I share on Github.
Expect developments in sporadic bursts.

All updates are syndicated to <a href="http://si.github.com/">my Github page</a>.

Hat tip to <a href="http://benhowdle89.github.com/">Ben Howdle</a> for his Ã¼ber-helpful foundation and introduction to the <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars Javascript templating library</a>
